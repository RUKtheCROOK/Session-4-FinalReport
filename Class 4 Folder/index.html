              My name is <b><i>John Anthony Garcia III</i></b
              >. I grew up in El Paso TX and moved around alot because my dad
              was in the military. From Texas I moved to Nebraska where I
              started highschool. In highschool I met the love of my life,
              <b><i>Megan Grace</i></b
              >, and shortly after joined the United States Air Force. In the
              Air Force I was a <ins>Space Systems Operator</ins> and a
              <ins>GPS Warfighter</ins>. My main specialty was
              <ins>Navigation Warfare</ins> and I took part in many excersizes
              and real world operations. I did this for upwards of 5 years
              before separating from the service. After separating I decided
              that I wanted to work in the tech feild and decided that SDGKU was
              the right place for me to learn how to code. Currently I am trying
              to learn as much as I can to hopefully secure a job as a software
              engineer in Nebraska before moving on to somewhere with more
              adventure! <br /><br />
              Adventure= Somwhere with an ocean preferebly: Floridia,
              California, or maybe even overseas.
